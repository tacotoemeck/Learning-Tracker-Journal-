day off
coding 8.30am - 7.30pm

solved level 5 kata: regex password checker

carried on working on a codeStudyTracker. App is almost ready but there are some errors. Any item in a list after item indexed 0, does not allow adding resultUrl and notes to it. This is due to a problem with use of .this followed by a querrySelector. It targets only first item in the list. I tried making it into an array, iterating through it and many other options. Finally came to a solution while in the shower to use an item's index instead of targeting it with .this. I will need to see if it works now. 

Otherwise, I need to bring back more structure into my studies. Hopefully the app itself will help.
